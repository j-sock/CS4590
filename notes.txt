notes on making alarms from the sonification handbook

"For Patterson, the alarm is designed with
a structural hierarchy (see Fig.
19.1
): the base unit is a 100 to 300 ms long pulse. This
pulse is repeated several times, at different pitches and/or intensity, using different tempi.
The resulting sound, made up of these consecutive components, is a sound burst. This
burst is about 2s long, and is perceived as a rhythmic atonal melody. The combination of
bursts makes up the entire alarm.
The alarm provides for silences between bursts, to give the crew time to communicate and
react adequately. Edworthy et al.â€™s study (1991) shows that the faster the rate, the higher
the pitch and the more irregular the harmonics, the greater the perceived urgency."
